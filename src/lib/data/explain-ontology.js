These semantic concepts — the “nouns” of the enterprise — enable the full range of Human+AI teams to securely interact with and manipulate complex underlying information. Multimodal Data Plane (MMDP) makes it easy to incorporate data from common data platforms such as Databricks, Snowflake, and BigQuery into the Ontology."

Logic can range from simple business rules to conventional ML models, LLM-driven functions, or complex multi-step orchestrations that span multiple compute engines. Compute Modules accelerates the ability to integrate and operationalize your existing code, models, and business logic within the Ontology."
